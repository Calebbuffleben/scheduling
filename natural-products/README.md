## Multi-tenant Implementation

### Middleware
The application uses Clerk middleware to handle organization context:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default clerkMiddleware(async (_, event) => {
  const { userId, orgId } = await getAuth(event);

  // Organization routing and context handling
  const pathOrgId = event.nextUrl.pathname.split('/').find((segment: string) => 
    segment.startsWith('org_')
  );

  // ... organization context logic
});
```

### API Routes
All API routes are organization-aware:

```typescript
// Example API route
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const organizationId = req.headers['x-organization-id'] as string;
  
  if (!organizationId) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Organization ID is required" });
  }

  // Organization-specific logic
}
```

### Data Access
Products are automatically scoped to organizations:

```typescript
// Example repository method
async findAll(organizationId: string) {
  return await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: { organizationId }
  });
}
```

## URL Structure

- `/` - Home page
- `/sign-in` - Authentication
- `/create-organization` - Organization creation
- `/{tenant_id}/dashboard` - Organization dashboard
- `/{tenant_id}/products` - Product management
- `/{tenant_id}/products/{product_id}` - Product details
- `/{tenant_id}/members` - Member management (admin only)
- `/{tenant_id}/billing` - Billing management (admin only)
- `/{tenant_id}/danger-zone` - Dangerous operations (owner only)

## Security Features

1. **Data Isolation**
   - Each organization's data is completely isolated

## Middleware Documentation

The application uses a sophisticated middleware system to handle authentication, authorization, and organization access control.

### Route Protection

#### Public Routes
```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/',
  '/sign-in(.*)',
  '/sign-up(.*)',
  '/api/public/(.*)'
]);
```
These routes are accessible without authentication. They include:
- Homepage
- Authentication pages
- Public API endpoints

#### Organization Routes
```typescript
const isOrgRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/org/(.*)/dashboard',
  '/org/(.*)/products',
  '/org/(.*)/settings'
]);
```
Basic organization routes requiring member access:
- Organization dashboard
- Product management
- Basic settings

#### Admin Routes
```typescript
const isOrgAdminRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/org/(.*)/members',
  '/org/(.*)/billing',
  '/org/(.*)/settings/advanced'
]);
```
Routes requiring administrative privileges:
- Member management
- Billing operations
- Advanced settings

#### Owner Routes
```typescript
const isOrgOwnerRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/org/(.*)/danger-zone',
  '/org/(.*)/delete'
]);
```
Routes restricted to organization owners:
- Dangerous operations
- Organization deletion

### Access Control Flow

1. **Public Access Check**
   ```typescript
   if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
     return NextResponse.next();
   }
   ```
   - Allows unrestricted access to public routes
   - No authentication required

2. **Organization Context**
   ```typescript
   const orgId = req.nextUrl.pathname.split('/').find(segment => 
     segment.startsWith('org_')
   );
   ```
   - Extracts organization ID from URL
   - Used for context and access control

3. **Member Access**
   ```typescript
   if (isOrgRoute(req)) {
     await auth.protect();
     // ... organization context handling
   }
   ```
   - Requires basic authentication
   - Sets organization context in headers
   - Enables organization-specific data access

4. **Admin Access**
   ```typescript
   if (isOrgAdminRoute(req)) {
     await auth.protect((has) => {
       return has({ permission: 'org:admin' }) || 
              has({ permission: 'org:owner' });
     });
   }
   ```
   - Requires admin or owner permissions
   - Enables access to administrative functions

5. **Owner Access**
   ```typescript
   if (isOrgOwnerRoute(req)) {
     await auth.protect((has) => has({ permission: 'org:owner' }));
   }
   ```
   - Strictest permission level
   - Required for critical operations

6. **Organization Selection**
   ```typescript
   if (!orgId && !isPublicRoute(req)) {
     await auth.protect();
     return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/organization-selector', req.url));
   }
   ```
   - Redirects authenticated users without an organization context
   - Ensures proper organization selection

### Organization Context Headers

When accessing organization routes, the middleware adds organization context:
```typescript
const requestHeaders = new Headers(req.headers);
requestHeaders.set('x-organization-id', orgId.replace('org_', ''));
```

This enables:
- Organization-specific data filtering
- Proper multi-tenant isolation
- Context-aware API responses

### URL Pattern Matching

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```
The middleware applies to:
- All application routes
- API routes
- Excludes static files and Next.js internals

### Permission Levels

1. **Public**
   - No authentication required
   - Access to public pages and resources

2. **Member**
   - Basic authentication required
   - Access to organization-specific content
   - View and interact with products

3. **Admin**
   - Enhanced permissions
   - Member management
   - Billing access
   - Advanced settings

4. **Owner**
   - Highest permission level
   - Critical organization operations
   - Complete administrative control

### Best Practices

1. **Route Organization**
   - Keep routes organized by permission level
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Maintain consistent URL structure

2. **Permission Checks**
   - Always check permissions before access
   - Use the most restrictive permission necessary
   - Combine permissions logically when needed

3. **Organization Context**
   - Always include organization context in headers
   - Validate organization access
   - Maintain proper isolation between organizations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Redirect unauthorized users appropriately
   - Maintain security during errors
   - Provide clear user feedback

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - All non-public routes require authentication
   - Uses Clerk's secure authentication system
   - Proper session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Granular permission system
   - Proper permission validation

3. **Data Isolation**
   - Organization-specific data access
   - Proper header management
   - Secure context handling

4. **URL Security**
   - Proper route matching
   - Protected sensitive routes
   - Secure parameter handling

## User and Organization Flow

### Registration and Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - New users sign up at `/sign-up`
   - Clerk handles the registration process
   - Required information:
     - Email address
     - Password
     - Name
   - Email verification is required
   - After verification, users are redirected to the organization creation/selection page

2. **User Authentication**
   - Existing users sign in at `/sign-in`
   - Clerk manages authentication
   - Support for:
     - Email/password
     - Social logins (Google, GitHub)
     - Multi-factor authentication (optional)
   - Upon successful login, users are redirected to:
     - Their organization if they belong to one
     - Organization selector if they belong to multiple organizations
     - Organization creation if they don't belong to any

3. **Organization Creation**
   - New organizations are created at `/create-organization`
   - Required information:
     - Organization name
     - Organization slug (auto-generated, editable)
   - The creator automatically becomes the organization owner
   - After creation, users are redirected to the organization dashboard

4. **Organization Invitation**
   - Organization admins/owners can invite users at `/org/{org_id}/members/invite`
   - Invitation process:
     - Enter email address
     - Select role (Member, Admin, Owner)
     - Send invitation
   - Invited users receive an email with a link to join
   - New users are prompted to create an account
   - Existing users are added to the organization directly

### Role and Permission Management

1. **Default Roles**
   - **Owner**: Full control, can delete organization
   - **Admin**: Can manage members and settings
   - **Member**: Basic access to organization resources

2. **Permission Assignment**
   - Roles are assigned during:
     - Organization creation (creator becomes Owner)
     - User invitation (specified by inviter)
     - Role management (by Admins/Owners)

3. **Role Management**
   - Organization admins/owners can manage roles at `/org/{org_id}/members`
   - Available actions:
     - Promote members to Admin
     - Demote admins to Member
     - Transfer ownership (Owners only)
     - Remove members

### Organization Switching

1. **Organization Selector**
   - Available at `/organization-selector`
   - Lists all organizations the user belongs to
   - Shows the user's role in each organization
   - Allows creating a new organization

2. **Active Organization Context**
   - The active organization is determined by the URL path
   - Organization context is maintained in:
     - URL path (`/{tenant_id}/...`)
     - Request headers (`x-organization-id`)
     - Client-side context

3. **Organization Switching Process**
   - User selects an organization from the selector
   - User is redirected to that organization's dashboard
   - All subsequent requests include the organization context
   - Data is filtered based on the active organization

### Data Access Flow

1. **Initial Data Load**
   - When accessing an organization page:
     - Middleware validates organization access
     - Organization ID is added to request headers
     - API requests include organization context

2. **API Request Flow**
   - Client makes request to API endpoint
   - Middleware adds organization context
   - API controller extracts organization ID
   - Database queries filter by organization ID
   - Response includes only organization-specific data

3. **Data Modification Flow**
   - User submits form/makes change
   - Request includes organization context
   - Server validates organization access
   - Data is saved with organization association
   - Response confirms successful operation

### Organization Lifecycle

1. **Creation Phase**
   - Organization is created
   - Initial owner is assigned
   - Default settings are established

2. **Growth Phase**
   - Members are invited
   - Products are added
   - Settings are customized

3. **Maintenance Phase**
   - Member roles are adjusted
   - Products are updated
   - Settings are refined

4. **Termination Phase**
   - Organization deletion is initiated by owner
   - Confirmation is required
   - All associated data is removed

### Implementation Examples

#### User Registration Component
```typescript
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const SignUpPage = () => (
  <div className="auth-container">
    <h1>Create an Account</h1>
    <SignUp 
      path="/sign-up"
      routing="path"
      signInUrl="/sign-in"
      redirectUrl="/organization-selector"
    />
  </div>
);

export default SignUpPage;
```

#### Organization Creation Component
```typescript
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useClerk } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const CreateOrganizationPage = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();
  const router = useRouter();
  const { createOrganization } = useClerk();
  
  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    try {
      const organization = await createOrganization({ name: data.name });
      router.push(`/${organization.id}/dashboard`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to create organization", error);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <h1>Create Organization</h1>
      <input {...register("name", { required: true })} placeholder="Organization Name" />
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CreateOrganizationPage;
```

#### Organization Selector Component
```typescript
import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const OrganizationSelector = () => {
  const { organizationList, isLoaded } = useOrganizationList();
  const router = useRouter();
  
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  const switchOrganization = (orgId) => {
    router.push(`/${orgId}/dashboard`);
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Organizations</h1>
      <ul>
        {organizationList.map((org) => (
          <li key={org.organization.id}>
            <button onClick={() => switchOrganization(org.organization.id)}>
              {org.organization.name}
            </button>
            <span>Role: {org.role}</span>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <a href="/create-organization">Create New Organization</a>
    </div>
  );
};

export default OrganizationSelector;
```

# Stripe Integration

The application integrates with Stripe for subscription management and billing. Here's an overview of the subscription flow:

1. **Pricing Plans**: The available subscription plans are defined in the `src/pages/pricing/index.tsx` file. Each plan specifies a name, price, description, features, and a Stripe Price ID.

2. **Checkout**: When a user clicks the "Subscribe" button on the pricing page, the `Checkout` component (`src/components/Checkout/Checkout.tsx`) is triggered. This component sends a request to the `/api/subscriptions/create-subscription` endpoint with the selected plan's Price ID.

3. **Subscription Creation**: The `/api/subscriptions/create-subscription` API route (`src/pages/api/subscriptions/create-subscription.ts`) receives the Price ID and creates a new Stripe Checkout Session. It returns the Session URL to the client.

4. **Redirection**: The `Checkout` component redirects the user to the Stripe Checkout page using the Session URL received from the server. The user completes the payment process on the Stripe-hosted page.

5. **Webhooks**: After a successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook to the application. The webhook handler (not shown in the provided code) should be implemented to update the user's subscription status in the database.

6. **Access Control**: The application should use middleware to check the user's subscription status and enable/disable access to features based on their plan.

Note: Make sure to set up the required Stripe API keys and configure the webhook endpoint in your production environment.

For more information on integrating Stripe subscriptions, refer to the [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/build-subscription?ui=checkout).
